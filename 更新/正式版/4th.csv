Every time when relations become less than 0, Defcon (a number which shows how close is the world to a large-scale conflict) becomes lower, and you will get a crisis event. When Defcon is less than 2, your only choice will be to start a detente, which costs some money, or to start cooperating with the USA, which will cost some of leninism's achievements (some doctrines will become more pro-american). Or you can just nuke the imperialists (if you want to). However, depending on some factions' positions majority in the Supreme Council, detente can be your only available option. If relations are more than 100, Defcon will rise, but not higher than 5.b) Income. It shows how much money you gain or spend (if the number is negative) at the end of each turn. Income (or spendings, excluding event and map actions spendings) arrives every 2 turns.) Relations with China. It works similarly to the USA relations, but they don't affect Defcon.

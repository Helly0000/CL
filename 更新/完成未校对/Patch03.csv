You quickly dragged your people there and, in August 1991, when the socialist camp collapsed and the same thing threatened the Soviet Union, you became the informal leader of the State Emergency Committee, so Yeltsin was isolated at his cottage, the Supreme Soviet was stormed, and the unrest in the Baltic states suppressed. Gorbachev is gone and now it's your time to rule the country...\nHooray! Hooray! Hooray!\n",国家紧急状态委员会\n1988年时你没有和利加乔夫勾结，你对乌克兰的保守统治也是成功的，因此你被批准进入1990年成立的苏联安全委员会，并于1990年12月被任命为内政部长以稳定国内局势。不久在1991年8月，各社会主义国家崩溃，苏联也陷入危机时，你成为了国家紧急委员会的非正式领导。最终叶利钦在他的小屋被隔离，最高苏维埃被清洗，波罗的海国家的骚乱被镇压。戈尔巴乔夫滚蛋了，现在是时候由你统治这个国家了…\n乌拉！乌拉！乌拉！\n

You opposed this and entered into an alliance with Ligachev and Gromyko, and as a result, at the 1988 plenum, when Gorbachev proposed an early way to implement innovations, you boldly and decisively attacked him, accusing him of voluntarism, the problems of the Soviet economy, and the restoration of capitalism. You were supported by Ligachev and Gromyko. Opponents were not allowed to say a word. Displacement took place.\nHooray! Hooray! Hooray!\n",取代戈尔巴乔夫\n戈尔巴乔夫不愿停下脚步而是提出了要对国家进行激进的改革 - 在经济衰退和各地民族主义大肆发展的背景下，要求引入成熟的市场和多元化的政治意识形态。你对此持反对意见，对此你接下了利加乔夫和葛罗米柯递出的橄榄枝，加入了他们的联盟。在1988年的一次全体会议上，戈尔巴乔夫提出了实施革新的初始步骤。你大胆而果断地攻击他，指责他的唯意志论，苏联经济问题以及资本主义的复辟。 你得到了利加乔夫和葛罗米柯的支持。反对者不允许说一句话。戈尔巴乔夫被我们取代了。\n乌拉！乌拉！乌拉！\n

You were the first after Yeltsin called on the world not to submit to the self-proclaimed State Emergency Committee, and the Ukrainian people elected you the First President of Ukraine in December 1991. And your signature was one of the three, set forth on the documents of the Belovezhsky collusion. Ruling until 1993, you were able to improve your condition to a multitude of billions of dollars, cottages, cars and yachts abroad, negotiate with the Russian Federation on territorial integrity in exchange for the export of nuclear weapons and turn the second industry and economic power into a Soviet republic in one of the most backward countries in Europe.\nJune 9, 1993 in Donbass began an indefinite strike of miners, held against a backdrop of a severe economic crisis. In view of this, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on June 22 went to meet the strikers and fulfilled their demand - they appointed a new presidential election on September 26, 1993. You took second place, receiving 30% of the vote.\nYou have a lot of money. You can live on!\n",第一任总统\n因为你的灵活手腕和长期以来履行对领导的承诺，戈尔巴乔夫亲自称赞你在改革取得深远成就。接着你紧随叶利钦，呼吁世界不要支持自说自话的国家紧急状态委员会。1991年12月你成为了乌克兰第一位民选总统，并作为三国元首之一，在别洛韦日协议（独联体协议）上签名。你的统治持续到了1993年，挣取了数十亿美元，并在国外买了别墅、轿车和游艇。另一方面，你和俄罗斯联邦进行谈判，以放弃核武器为交换获得了确保领土完整的保障。你上台前，乌克兰是苏联内工业和经济第二强国，而现在她成为欧洲最落后的国家之一。\n1993年6月9日，因严重的经济危机，顿巴斯开始长期罢工。鉴于此，乌克兰最高拉达于6月22日前去同罢工者们谈判并达成协议 - 他们于9月26日通过总统选举选出了新总统。你在选举中获30%的选票，位列第二。\n不过你吃喝不愁，你可以继续过滋润的生活！\n

Actions require fulfillment of listed requirements and at least 1 authority point. While actions with different countries are also different, there are some general ones:\n- Dotations, support and financing of a country will drain your resources and reduce your income. It's cheap to finance some countries, but a large number of dotations can damage your economy. Dotations for third world countries work differently.\n- Military aid or invasions reduce the size and power of your army. Changes are not significant, but don't do it too often\n- The diplomatic map is the only way to find out support of the USSR countries. Keep in mind, that when country leaves the USSR, so called \""Status\"" appear - it shows likeliness of the country to join NATO. If status reaches , country will join NATO and it will become a lot harder to return it\n- Warsaw pact works similarly. If loyalty is too low - country will distance from the USSR, if liberalisation is high - it will pass capitalistic reforms. Neither will end well.",有时会显示有关该国的其他信息 - 执政党，当地战争，忠诚度等。\n 许多国家或地区都可以使用以下按钮进行互动。行动要求履行所列要求和至少1个政治点。虽然与不同国家的行动也不同，但有一些一般性的：\n - 捐助，支持和融资一个国家将消耗你的资源并减少你的收入。为一些国家提供融资的成本很低，但大量的捐助可能会损害您的经济。捐助第三世界国家则以不同的方式运作。\n - 军事援助或入侵，减少了你的军队的规模和力量。变化并不大，但也不要经常这样做。\n - 外交地图是寻求苏联国家支持的唯一途径。请记住，当国家离开苏联时，所谓的“状态”出现 - 它显示了加入北约的国家的可能性。如果状态达到了，国家将加入北约，拉回它将变得更加困难。\n - 华沙​​协议的运作方式类似。如果忠诚度太低 - 国家将与苏联保持距离，如果自由化程度很高 - 它将通过资本主义改革。两者都不会有好下场。

After the operation the social and independent regime of a local dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega was overthrown and replaced by proamerican forces led by a new president Guillemo.

Most of the cities are in ruins and citizens living in the combat zones either flee abroad or help armed forces.

We left with nothing. This introduces confusion among the leadership of the GKChP, Yazov and Kryuchkov respond about the future fate of the GKChP with doubt.",戈尔巴乔夫向抵达的国家紧急状态委员会成员表示他无法飞往莫斯科，因为“他穿着（伤员需要穿着的）紧身衣，而且腿脚不便。”总统还表示，无论如何，即使他将会被截肢，他也要飞到莫斯科去签订条约，并拒绝签署任何文件。我们两手空空地离开了，这令国家紧急状态委员会的领导层感到困惑，亚佐夫和克留奇科夫对委员会的未来命运表示了怀疑。

A consequence of this was the failure of the GKChP and its dissolution under the pressure of circumstances. Later, many GKChP figures were arrested, and Pugo committed suicide, unable to bear failing of betray his attempts to save the country. Gorbachev and his closest associates prevented Lukyanov and the Supreme Soviet from trying to preserve the USSR by dissolving the Central Committee and the Union government. The signing of an even more confederal new union treaty has already been prevented by the Belovezhsky conspiracy, where the leaders of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus unconstitutionally announced the dissolution of the USSR.",您无法获得苏联官员和群众们的支持来击败反对派。这样的情况是国家紧急状态委员会的失败，它在现状的压力下解体了。不久，很多国家紧急委员会成员被逮捕了，无法忍受不能达成其拯救祖国的目标和对这一目标的背叛的普戈选择了自杀。戈尔巴乔夫及其亲信阻止了卢基扬诺夫和最高苏维埃试图通过解散党的中央委员会和政府来保留苏联的努力。更加联邦化的联盟条约的签订则已经被俄罗斯、乌克兰和白俄罗斯三国领导人违宪地声称苏联已经解体的《别洛韦日协定》所阻止。

Then, Yazov and Kryuchkov, enlisting the support of Lukyanov and the Supreme Council, were able to organize the transfer of the signing of a new union treaty. As a result, on August 24, 1991, an agreement was signed on the reorganization of the USSR into the Union of Sovereign Soviet Republics, which included Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Georgia, Moldova and Armenia.",您无法获得官员们的支持，在您领导下的混乱造成了国家紧急状态委员会成员们对您治下的“血腥热月”的恐惧。随后，获得了卢基扬诺夫和最高苏维埃支持的亚佐夫和克留奇科夫成功地组织了向签订新的联盟条约的转换。其结果是，在1991年8月24日，将苏联重新组织为独立苏维埃国家联合体的协议得以签署，其中包括立陶宛、拉脱维亚、爱沙尼亚、格鲁吉亚、摩尔多瓦和亚美尼亚。

However, movement began to collapse after attacks on proffesor Kitov from Khruschev and the Party. Of course, attacks stopped when Brezhnev came to power, but other ideas bothered people and government wasn't encouraged to restore the movement. Only at the and of 70s some steps towards automatisation began, but during Andropov's rule Party was more concerned with chinese economical experiments instead of it.

You will use them to change doctrines, appoint new ministers and interact with other countries on the World map. Some events can also use points. These points can drop below 0, but they are restored over time.\ng) Loyalty of the CSS. Rioting special services are not a good thing. If loyalty is too low, you will have to confront them. People and army can help you, but it's better to prevent such situations.\nh) Loyalty of generals. Unhappy generals can easily organize a military coup. But you will still have the CSS and people on your side.\ni)Science points. You will spend these points in the Academy of Sciences to develop new technologies, which will surely help you. They are gained through financing science and some other factors, for example, space staion MIR",d）军队力量。虽然超级大国之间的战争已经不复存在，但仍然需要强大的军队来进行地方冲突和某些行动。当然，即使是超级大国也可以被更强大的敌人攻击。\ne）苏联预算。除黄金储备外，所有可用资金都可以用于不同的经济领域。\nf）政治点数。即使是统治者也必须有足够的权力才能做出改变。您将使用它们来改变学说，任命新的部长并在世界地图上与其他国家互动。有些活动也可以使用点数。这些点数可能低于0，但它们会随着时间的推移而恢复。\ng）KGB的忠诚度。骚乱特殊服务并不是一件好事。如果忠诚度太低，你将不得不面对他们。人民和军队可以帮助你，但最好是防止这种情况发生。\nh）将军的忠诚度。不悦的将军很容易组织军事政变。但是你仍然会拥有KGB和忠于你的人员。\ni）科学点。您将在科学院花费这些点来开发新技术，这肯定会对您有所帮助。它们是通过资助科学和其他一些因素获得的，例如和平号空间站

Actions require fulfillment of listed requirements and at least 1 authority point. While actions with different countries are also different, there are some general ones:\n- Dotations, support and financing of a country will drain your resources and reduce your income. It's cheap to finance some countries, but a large number of dotations can damage your economy. Dotations for third world countries work differently.\n- Military aid or invasions reduce the size and power of your army. Changes are not significant, but don't do it too often\n- The diplomatic map is the only way to find out support of the USSR countries. Keep in mind, that when country leaves the USSR, so called \""Status\"" appear - it shows likeliness of the country to join NATO. If status reaches 0, country will join NATO and it will become a lot harder to return it\n- Warsaw pact works similarly. If loyalty is too low - country will distance from the USSR, if liberalisation is high - it will pass capitalistic reforms. Neither will end well.",有时会显示有关该国的其他信息 - 执政党，当地战争，忠诚度等。\n 许多国家或地区都可以使用以下按钮进行互动。行动要求履行所列要求和至少1个政治点。虽然与不同国家的行动也不同，但有一些一般性的：\n - 捐助，支持和融资一个国家将消耗你的资源并减少你的收入。为一些国家提供融资的成本很低，但大量的捐助可能会损害您的经济。捐助第三世界国家则以不同的方式运作。\n - 军事援助或入侵，减少了你的军队的规模和力量。变化并不大，但也不要经常这样做。\n - 外交地图是寻求苏联国家支持的唯一途径。请记住，当国家离开苏联时，所谓的“状态”出现 - 它显示了加入北约的国家的可能性。如果状态达到了，国家将加入北约，拉回它将变得更加困难。\n - 华沙​​协议的运作方式类似。如果忠诚度太低 - 国家将与苏联保持距离，如果自由化程度很高 - 它将通过资本主义改革。两者都不会有好下场。

You quickly dragged your people there and, in August 1991, when the socialist camp collapsed and the same thing threatened the Soviet Union, you became the informal leader of the State Emergency Committee, so Yeltsin was isolated at his cottage, the Supreme Soviet was stormed, and the unrest in the Baltic states suppressed. Gorbachev is gone and now it's your time to rule the country...\nHooray! Hooray! Hooray!\n",国家紧急状态委员会\n1988年时你没有和利加乔夫勾结，你对乌克兰的保守统治也是成功的，因此你被批准进入1990年成立的苏联安全委员会，并于1990年12月被任命为内政部长以稳定国内局势。不久在1991年8月，各社会主义国家崩溃，苏联也陷入危机时，你成为了国家紧急委员会的非正式领导。最终叶利钦在他的小屋被隔离，最高苏维埃被清洗，波罗的海国家的骚乱被镇压。戈尔巴乔夫滚蛋了，现在是时候由你统治这个国家了…\n乌拉！乌拉！乌拉！\n

You opposed this and entered into an alliance with Ligachev and Gromyko, and as a result, at the 1988 plenum, when Gorbachev proposed an early way to implement innovations, you boldly and decisively attacked him, accusing him of voluntarism, the problems of the Soviet economy, and the restoration of capitalism. You were supported by Ligachev and Gromyko. Opponents were not allowed to say a word. Displacement took place.\nHooray! Hooray! Hooray!\n",取代戈尔巴乔夫\n戈尔巴乔夫不愿停下脚步而是提出了要对国家进行激进的改革 - 在经济衰退和各地民族主义大肆发展的背景下，要求引入成熟的市场和多元化的政治意识形态。你对此持反对意见，对此你接下了利加乔夫和葛罗米柯递出的橄榄枝，加入了他们的联盟。在1988年的一次全体会议上，戈尔巴乔夫提出了实施革新的初始步骤。你大胆而果断地攻击他，指责他的唯意志论，苏联经济问题以及资本主义的复辟。 你得到了利加乔夫和葛罗米柯的支持。反对者不允许说一句话。戈尔巴乔夫被我们取代了。\n乌拉！乌拉！乌拉！\n

You were the first after Yeltsin called on the world not to submit to the self-proclaimed State Emergency Committee, and the Ukrainian people elected you the First President of Ukraine in December 1991. And your signature was one of the three, set forth on the documents of the Belovezhsky collusion. Ruling until 1993, you were able to improve your condition to a multitude of billions of dollars, cottages, cars and yachts abroad, negotiate with the Russian Federation on territorial integrity in exchange for the export of nuclear weapons and turn the second industry and economic power into a Soviet republic in one of the most backward countries in Europe.\nJune 9, 1993 in Donbass began an indefinite strike of miners, held against a backdrop of a severe economic crisis. In view of this, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on June 22 went to meet the strikers and fulfilled their demand - they appointed a new presidential election on September 26, 1993. You took second place, receiving 30% of the vote.\nYou have a lot of money.

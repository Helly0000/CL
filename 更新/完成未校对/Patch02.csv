Residents were warned about the existing danger and in the first days after the accident the population of the 30-kilometer zone was evacuated. In carrying out work to combat the consequences of the accident, many station personnel received large doses of radiation, and some even fatal.\n",乌克兰社会主义共和国的大众媒体突然开始播报有关于人民生活安全的内容，一幅关于中东欧气流流动的气候地图也被放映在电视屏幕上。居民被告知外出存在危险，在事故发生后的第一天，距事发地点30公里区域的居民被紧急疏散。\n

The persons responsible for concealment of information, subsequently explained their decision by the need to prevent panic among the population. First Secretary of the CPU V.Shcherbitsky was absent from the parade for health reasons and was resting at the cottage in the Crimea. Instead, the parade was held by 1 Secretary of the Central Committee of the Kiev City Committee on the instructions of Mikhail S. Gorbachev.\n",但是基辅以及乌克兰和白俄罗斯的其他城市则照常举行了庆祝五一节的游行和庆祝活动。负责隐瞒事故的人后来解释说，他们的决定是为了防止人民产生恐慌情绪。由于健康原因，乌克兰共产党的第一书记--谢尔比茨基没有参加在基辅的庆祝活动而是在克里米亚的别墅中休息。相反，阅兵式是在戈尔巴乔夫的指示下，由基辅市党委的一名中央书记举行的\n

This required the allocation of funds and led to the receiving radiation by special brigades, but the area was secured. At the same time, the task was to evacuate the population from the territories for another 30 km away from the disaster site in order to avoid civilian irradiation. The safe ways of moving the columns of the evacuated population were determined taking into account the already obtained radiation reconnaissance data. Such a large campaign attracted the attention of an independent publisher and began to spread panic among the population.\n",用于防辐射的石棺的建造围绕着切尔诺贝利核电站展开了，额外防护的建设被取消，乌克兰的核电站退役了，新的乌克兰核电站的建设和服役都被暂停。如此大的应急举措需要分配预算并动用用于监测辐射的特殊部队的进驻，现在整个区域都被保护了起来。同时必须立即开始疏散事发地点30公里内的居民，否则会多出一大批的辐射病受害者。应急指挥部已经根据辐射的传播方向制定了一条合适而安全的撤离线路。但是我们这样大张旗鼓的举动已经受到了一家独立报纸的注意，现在一些媒体已经开始利用传媒散播恐怖情绪。\n

It seems that a large part of the subsidies and credits went into the hands of scammers, but the people are pleased with the changes that have begun.",个人和广泛合作企业家的引入导致了私营贸易商和党员之间的腐败关系的增长，以高价炒作假冒过期商品的投机运动的增长（从而导致国营商店赤字的增加），以及为了从企业破产中获利的虚假计划和欺诈计划的出现。

These points can drop below 0, but they are restored over time.\ng) Loyalty of the CSS. Rioting special services are not a good thing. If loyalty is too low, you will have to confront them.

Actions require fulfillment of listed requirements and at least 1 authority point. While actions with different countries are also different, there are some general ones:\n- Dotations, support and financing of a country will drain your resources and reduce your income. It's cheap to finance some countries, but a large number of dotations can damage your economy. Dotations for third world countries work differently.\n- Military aid or invasions reduce the size and power of your army. Changes are not significant, but don't do it too often\n- The diplomatic map is the only way to find out support of the USSR countries. Keep in mind, that when country leaves the USSR, so called \""Status\"" appear - it shows likeliness of the country to join NATO. If status reaches 0, country will join NATO and it will become a lot harder to return it\n- Warsaw pact works similarly. If loyalty is too low - country will distance from the USSR, if liberalisation is high - it will pass capitalistic reforms. Neither will end well.",有时会显示有关该国的其他信息 - 执政党，当地战争，忠诚度等。\n 许多国家或地区都可以使用以下按钮进行互动。行动要求履行所列要求和至少1个政治点。虽然与不同国家的行动也不同，但有一些一般性的：\n - 捐助，支持和融资一个国家将消耗你的资源并减少你的收入。为一些国家提供融资的成本很低，但大量的捐助可能会损害您的经济。捐助第三世界国家则以不同的方式运作。\n - 军事援助或入侵，减少了你的军队的规模和力量。变化并不大，但也不要经常这样做。\n - 外交地图是寻求苏联国家支持的唯一途径。请记住，当国家离开苏联时，所谓的“状态”出现 - 它显示了加入北约的国家的可能性。如果状态达到了，国家将加入北约，拉回它将变得更加困难。\n - 华沙​​协议的运作方式类似。如果忠诚度太低 - 国家将与苏联保持距离，如果自由化程度很高 - 它将通过资本主义改革。两者都不会有好下场。

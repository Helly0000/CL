"The construction of the sarcophagus began around the reactor, the construction of additional units was canceled, just like the nuclear power plant itself was decommissioned. This required the allocation of funds and led to the receiving radiation by special brigades, but the area was secured. At the same time, the task was to evacuate the population from the territories for another 30 km away from the disaster site in order to avoid civilian irradiation. The safe ways of moving the columns of the evacuated population were determined taking into account the already obtained radiation reconnaissance data. Such a large campaign attracted the attention of an independent publisher and began to spread panic among the population.\n","The construction of the sarcophagus began around the reactor, the construction of additional units was canceled, just like the nuclear power plant itself was decommissioned.

"On 19 August 1991, Special Forces of the KGB group Alfa, in amount of about 50 people, came to Yeltsin's cottage in Arkhangelsk. They approached the gates of the cottage, posing as VDV, who arrived on Assignment of the Defense Minister to increase the security of the village. However, one of the security guards of Yeltsin recognized him as an Alfa officer, who taught at the KGB courses. Yeltsin's guards invited Alfa fighters to dine in the dining room, but this was only a distracting maneuver. Elimination of Yeltsin occurred right in his office by one of the snipers, after which the explosion of the gas pipe was staged.","On 19 August 1991, Special Forces of the KGB group Alfa, in amount of about 50 people, came to Yeltsin's cottage in Arkhangelsk.

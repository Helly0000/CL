"GKCHP\nThanks to your successful conservative rule in Ukraine, given that you did not collude with Ligachev in 88, you were approved into the Security Council of the USSR formed in 1990 and appointed in December 1990 as the Minister of Internal Affairs to stabilize the situation in the country. You quickly dragged your people there and, in August 1991, when the socialist camp collapsed and the same thing threatened the Soviet Union, you became the informal leader of the State Emergency Committee, so Yeltsin was isolated at his cottage, the Supreme Soviet was stormed, and the unrest in the Baltic states suppressed. Gorbachev is gone and now it's your time to rule the country...\nHooray! Hooray!

This path wasn't easy. we had to restore Feoktistov's HIS project, then send ship modules to the orbit, so it could be constructed by astronauts on the MIR space station. And of course we had to prepare the crew. Their deed will be remembered by world history and it could become more famous than Neil Armstrong's steps.
